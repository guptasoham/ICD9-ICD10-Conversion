The US transitioned from ICD-9 to ICD-10 for several key reasons:

* ICD-9 was over 35 years old and contained outdated, obsolete terms inconsistent with current medical practice.
* The structure of ICD-9 limited the creation of new codes, while ICD-10 provides more room for code expansion and greater specificity in patient diagnoses.
* ICD-10 codes offer better support for patient care, improve management and quality measurement, and enhance analytics capabilities.
* The transition to ICD-10 aligns the US with other major industrialized nations, as it was the last to make this switch.
* ICD-10 enables improvements in coordinating patient care across providers, advancing public health research and surveillance, supporting innovative payment models, and enhancing fraud detection efforts.
